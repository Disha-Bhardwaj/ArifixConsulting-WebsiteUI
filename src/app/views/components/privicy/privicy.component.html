    <p class="textP">This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Demos: A Network for Ideas and Action, Ltd.
        (“Demos”, “Us” or “We”) collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (“Users” or
        “You”) of its website located at www.demos.org (the “Website”).<br><br>

        The Types of Information Demos Collects
        Non-personally identifiable information
        Demos may collect non-personally identifiable information about you whenever you visit the Website. Such
        information may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you used, the type of browser and
        operating system you used, the date and time you visited the Website, the Internet address of the site from
        which you linked to the Website, and which pages you viewed on the Website.<br><br>

        Web browser cookies
        Demos may use “cookies” to enhance your experience with the Website. A cookie is a small text file that is
        stored in your computer so that the Website can recognize you and keep track of your preferences. Use of cookies
        help to measure aggregate web statistics, such as collecting the number of Users to the Website, the number of
        repeat Users and the most popular webpages, to serve relevant content to a User as he/she browses the Internet,
        and for other purposes. You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies
        are being sent. If you do so, however, some parts of the Website may not function properly.<br><br>

        Personally identifiable information
        Demos, on its own and through select third party vendors, collects personally identifiable information, such as
        names, email addresses, mailing addresses and credit card information, from Users when they voluntarily provide
        such information to us, including, for example, when a User signs up to join our email list, purchases tickets
        to an event, completes the contact form, responds to a job posting, or donates money via the Website. Complete
        credit card information, however, is not stored.<br><br>

        How Demos Uses the Information that it Collects
        Demos uses Users’ personal information to better understand how Users use the Website so that we can improve the
        Website and its offerings. Demos also uses Users’ personal information for the purpose for which the Users
        provided the information, in other words, for example, to add you to our email list, to process your request for
        tickets to an event, to respond to your inquiry, to consider you for a job, or to process your donation. If you
        affirmatively opt-in to our email list, we will add you to our list. If at any time you wish to stop receiving
        emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any email Demos sends you.<br><br>

        How Demos Protects User Information
        Demos adopts appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to help
        protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, but
        Demos cannot guarantee that your information is 100% secure. Your credit card information is not stored by
        Demos.<br><br>

        Sharing Personal Information
        We use third party service providers, including, for example, Mailchimp, Rallybound, EventBrite and HiringThing,
        to help us operate the Website and administer activities on our behalf, such as collecting donations online and
        registering Users for events. These third party vendors may have access to User information, which becomes
        subject to their individual privacy policies. In addition, Demos shares personal information about Users with
        Demos Action, our sister organization. Demos may also share personal information with other like-minded
        organizations. In addition, Demos will share personally identifiable information about Users when required to do
        so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to
        respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. Demos will also share personally identifiable information
        if it believes it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of Demos or others.<br><br>

        Demos may also share personally identifiable information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
        merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of its business to another company.
        Moreover, Demos may share personally identifiable information about a User upon obtaining the User’s
        consent.<br><br>

        Demos may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information
        regarding Users with third parties.<br><br>

        Third Party Websites
        Demos may provide links from the Website to other websites. A link to a third party website does not constitute
        an endorsement of the linked site or its service. Moreover, it is important to understand that Demos does not
        control the content or links that appear on these third party websites and is not responsible for the practices
        employed by websites linked to or from the Website. These websites and services have their own privacy policies.
        Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that have a link to or from our Website, is
        subject to that website’s own terms and policies. This Privacy Policy covers only information collected through
        the use of Demos’ Website.<br><br>

        Do Not Track Signals
        Demos does not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals.<br><br>

        Compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
        Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important. For that reason, Demos never collects information
        on the Website from those it knows are under 13, and no part of the Website is structured to attract anyone
        under 13. If Demos becomes aware of having information about anyone under 13, it will promptly delete the
        information.<br><br>

        California Privacy Rights
        If you reside in California and have provided your personally identifiable information to Demos, you may request
        information once per calendar year about Demos’ disclosures of certain categories of your personally
        identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted
        to Demos by email addressed to info@demos.org.<br><br>

        Changes to this Privacy Policy
        Demos may update this Privacy Policy at any time. The date at the bottom of this page indicates when the Privacy
        Policy was last updated. Changes become effective upon posting. Your continued use of the Website after the
        Privacy Policy has been modified means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy. Demos encourages Users to
        frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about what information Demos collects and how it
        uses that information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically and become aware of any modifications since your last visit.<br><br>

        Your Acceptance of These Terms
        By using Demos’ Website, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy,
        please do not use the Website. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes to this
        Privacy Policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.<br><br>
